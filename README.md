MATLAB code used to solve the ECOPATH with ECOSIM (EwE) system of differential equations in MATLAB that measures changes in biomass for marine systems.

- EwE_biomass contains function for solving the system of differential equations, utilised by other files.

- sys_comp and spec_extinct investigate the affects of changing the number of interactions and number of species respectively.

- EwE_MATsim runs a single simulation using base values and plots the result.

- LV2_example and LV_mSpecies plots the Lotka-Volterra system of equations for 2 species and m species respectively.
